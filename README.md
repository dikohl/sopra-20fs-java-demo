- Download Intellij Ulitmate
    - https://www.jetbrains.com/student/
    - Ultimate Version allows you to work on JavaScript and Java Code in the same IDE
- Gradle
    - helps assemble & manage packages/dependencies and build an application
    - most important file(s)
        - build.gradle (file with all the info)
        - gradlew & gradlew.bat (startup scripts for windows and unix)
    - IntelliJ has a Gradle Tab where you can manage everything (no need to touch the files)
-  Project structure
    - src folder with 2 subfolders "main" & "test"
    - "main" contains all the production logic / code
    - "test" is basically a mirror of main and contains tests for the logic
- Java/Project Setup in IntelliJ
    - Correct Java Version (build and run!)
        - build: Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Gradle JVM -> 13 (might need to add 13 first)
        - run: Edit Configuration -> JRE -> 13 (might need to add 13 first)
- Building the Project
    - build: compile the
    - run: compile and start application (prod environment)
    - debug: compile and start application, able to use breakpoints etc (dev environment)
- Testing Code
    - short cut to create test from a class in "main" (Ctrl+Shift+T / Shift+⌘+T)
    - Run test with little play button
    - Debugging is also possible here
- Debugging Code
    - Breakpoints can be set next to the line number
    - F7 - F9 can be used to step through code and in to functions
    - You can use Watchers to see the value of variables at certain breakpoints
    
#Useful Intellij shortcuts
- Generate Template Code (empty Method etc.): **Ctrl+N or ⌘+N**

    - This way you can very quickly generate a new method
- Rename (anythin): **Shift+F6**
- Inline a variable/method: **Ctrl+Alt+N or Option+⌘+N**
- Search Class by name in project: **Double Shift** or **Alt+O or ⌘+O**
- Move line up/down: **Shift+Alt+Up/Down or Shift+⌘+Up/Down**
- Extract as Variable / Parameter / Method: **Alt+Ctrl+V/P/M or Option+⌘+V/P/M**
    - You can also just write ".var" or similar at the end (new App().var => App app = new App();)
- Create/Find Test: **Shift+Ctrl+T or Shift+⌘+T**
- Search Settings: **Shift+Alt+A or Shift+⌘+A**
